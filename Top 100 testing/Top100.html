The best game you've never played.<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>When I saw a preview for Culdcept in a gaming magazine, I knew I had to have it even though the preview was no more than a 2 paragraphs long with only a few pictures. The magazine described Culdcept as "Magic the Gathering meets Monopoly". Knowing that both of those are very fun and addictive games I was intrigued. However, I could tell that this was going to be a niche title in every sense of the term, and I wondered if it would actually released in the states. Luckily it was released near Christmas of 2003 and I got my copy right away. Sure enough, Culdcept is a fantastically deep and 
engrossing card battle/board game unlike anything else out there. With over 1000 cards to collect and infinite ways to formulate winning strategies, I highly 
recommend it to anyone who likes collectable card games or games where strategy is necessary. Unfortunately, it is hard to find Culdcept in stores because it had a pretty limited run, but since no one played it, Culdcept doesn't seem to command a very high price right now on eBay. On a side note, Culdcept is fantastically popular in Japan, and the version we got is actually part 2 over there. They have also released a few expansions in Japan... This combined with the fact that we will never see these expansions or any sequels thanks to Culdcept's lackluster sales in the USA will totally depress you once you realize how addictive and fun this game is.<p>

The king of early RPGs</center>

<p>Phantasy Star holds a special place in my heart, and I consider myself lucky 
that the first RPG I ever played was one of the best. Released in America in 1988 (before Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior), Phantasy Star was the first Japanese console based RPG released in the states. Phantasy Star had incredible graphics for the time with smoother first person movement in dungeons than games released 5 years later on 16 bit systems. The monsters were all animated and many took up most of the screen. There were 3 worlds to explore and a story that melded mythology and science fiction seamlessly. The characters were likable, and the quest was long and difficult, especially considering there were no hint books or other games like it at the time. Phantasy Star was revolutionary in 1988 and it still stands up to play today as a very solid and fun RPG. Plus this is the game that got me into RPGs and arguably the game that actually made me a gamer instead of just someone who played games casually. I belong to the old guard of people who wish Sega would stop screwing around with boring old Phantasy Star Online and just release a new single player Phantasy star in the vein of 1,2,and 4. I was excited for the Sega Ages remakes, but it seems like they've been axed and will never see the light of day in the states, making me think I 
must have been born in the wrong country. Even so, I'll love Phantasy Star forever no matter how much Sega tries to take that away from me. <p>

Star Wars + Great RPG (Bioware)^ Freeform Gameplay = Incredible<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>If you know anything about me a few things are apparent: I love my RPGs and I'm a Star Wars Geek. That said, Knights of the Old Republic for me is like that old commercial where someone tripped and dropped their chocolate bar in their friend's peanut butter... a perfect symbiosis of 2 incredible component parts. KOTOR is great 
because there is so much freedom to play the game as you please. Be a perfect, pious 
Jedi like me and max out your light-side powers while helping people and resisting temptations, or succumb to them and fall to the darkside... and you will be tempted repeatedly. With a great mix of 
Jedi and non Jedi characters to join your party having dispositions that range from good to completely neutral to dangerously dark, there are seemingly endless ways to approach situations in the game. With a plot that is better than some of the 
prequels and expanded universe Star Wars material, KOTOR definitely contributes greatly to the Star Wars mythology. As a 
testament to how great KOTOR is, I know many people who are not RPG fans or not Star Wars geeks who have been completely obsessed with the game (although if you hated both I don't know if KOTOR could change your mind...).</P>

<p>Fun Fact - Knights of the Old Republic is the name of the original Tales of the Jedi Graphic Novel, and many of the gameplay elements mirror the comic's ideas, up to and including mentioning characters and events by name. </p>

<p>I love Street Fighter II... It may seem hard to believe this now, but in 1991 there was not a 7-11, or arcade that did not have a Street Fighter II machine and a huge line of rabid fans like me with their quarters up in a line on the bezel waiting for our turn to school or be schooled by the competition. I played Street Fighter II 
constantly, spending every quarter that came near me to learn the moves and get better at it. Everyone was caught up in the hype it seemed, with EGM and GamePro devoting half of their content to moves and 
strategies and their covers to SFII month after month. Like everyone else When Champion Edition came out I was 
ecstatic to be able to actually play as the bosses. Then SFII Turbo was released and the timing of the game was perfected. Super SFII gave us 4 new challengers,  new voices for the announcer 
and some of the characters, and sharpened the graphics considerably. Finally Super SFII Turbo bumped up the speed to an even more frenetic pace and introduced us to super moves. Each iteration brought a few new moves and minor tweaks, and while the magazines cried and railed for Capcom to just release SFIII instead of endless upgrades, I didn't mind at all. Taking one of my favorite games and continually improving it is always 
permissible in my book. It's 15 years later, and I'll still play Street Fighter II any chance I get. What a great game.</P>

2D Gaming Perfected.<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>I've always loved Castlevania, but even a diehard fan like me was blown away 
when I played Symphony of the Night. With gorgeous detailed 2D graphics that 
have aged far better than most of the 3D garbage on the Playstation and a 
soundtrack seemingly composed by the gods, this game had it all. Symphony 
combined action, exploration, and role playing elements to make it one of the 
best games of all time. With a huge castle to explore and a secret that doubled 
the amount of playtime in the game, Symphony of the Night will keep you busy for&nbsp; 
quite a while, and with its perfect gameplay, you'll surely play it again and 
again. If you really consider yourself a gamer but you have never played this 
game,&nbsp; you're out of your mind. Take a dollar and go buy yourself a clue, 
then get this game and play it right away. Truly one of the greatest games ever 
made. 

<p>- Interesting Note: Sony's ridiculous anti 2D bias almost killed this game. Why 
is it that some of the best games on the Playstation were the very ones Sony 
fought so hard to kill? This ignorant bias against 2D gaming has forever changed 
the industry for the worse in my humble opinion. <p>

Best mid game plot twist... Ever.<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>Like the rest of the nay-sayers, I hated the early screenshots of this game 
and feared that Nintendo and Miyamoto had finally lost it. How they could go 
from a realistic Link as seen in Ocarina of time to this cartoony Link was 
beyond me. However, being the massive Zelda fan I am, I preordered the game 
anyway, played my free Ocarina of time preorder bonus disk, and waited to see 
what they had done to my favorite series. Once I got the game it only took me 
about 3 minutes to become its biggest supporter. The expressiveness of the 
characters in Windwaker is unparalleled in any game I have played before or 
since playing it. The control is spot on, and the combat system is better than 
ever. It may seem completely unrelated to all the other Zelda games, but when 
you learn how the vast ocean in Windwaker relates to the other games you will be 
blown away by the deep and well woven plot. Also, while the game looks cartoony, 
you dispatch the end boss in a shockingly violent fashion that will prove once 
and for all that this is not a game for little kids. Aside from being a bit too 
easy and the ocean being sometimes painfully vast, Windwaker is a worthy heir to 
the glorious Zelda throne. <p>

Possibly the oddest pairing in gaming history...<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>Kingdom Hearts is another game I had serious doubts about when I first saw 
it. I was at E3 and saw early promotional materials for the game at the 
Squaresoft booth. Combining Final Fantasy and Disney characters seemed like a 
horrible idea that was driven more by the desire to market 2 massive franchises 
to people than a desire to make a good game. I can honestly say that I had no 
interest in playing this game whatsoever. However, once it came out I kept 
reading glowing reviews of it, and my friends kept recommending it. I finally 
decided I'd give it a chance, albeit reluctantly. To my great surprise and 
pleasure, I found a wonderfully deep and detailed action RPG in the vein of the 
Zelda games. The story in Kingdom Hearts actually manages to make the odd 
pairing of Squaresoft and Disney characters make sense, the voice work and 
general atmosphere of the game are fantastic, and the graphics are truly some of 
the best I've ever seen on the PS2. If you think that you are &quot;too cool&quot; or &quot;too 
old&quot; to be playing a game with Goofy and Donald Duck in it, I would highly 
recommend that you let go of your pride and give Kingdom Hearts a try - I doubt 
you'll be disappointed. I know I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel to this one!<p>

Puzzle Perfection.<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>Puzzle fans are an odd lot... we all tend to have our favorite puzzle games and 
passionately defend them. For my wife, the puzzle master, it's Dr. Mario, 
although she is so good she can beat me easily at any puzzle game. Personally, 
my favorite puzzle game has to be the splendid Tetris Attack on Super Nintendo. 
This game is actually a Japanese game called Panel De Pon, but here in the 
States it was given the name Tetris Attack... I guess they felt we wouldn't be 
able to figure out that the game was a puzzle game without the word Tetris in 
there. Anyway, in this game the tiles rise from the bottom, and with the cursor 
you are able to flip the location of two tiles. Lining up 3 or more tiles makes 
them disappear, and with a bit of practice you will soon be clearing 7 or more 
tiles at once. Combine this with awesome chain reactions, incredible 2 player 
competitions, great music, colorful graphics, and an excellent use of Yoshi and 
crew and you have one heck of a great game. I especially love the piranha plant 
that shouts &quot;Baby!&quot; every time it gets a combo and drops a ton of garbage blocks on its opponent.
	
	<b><i>&nbsp;</i>Be sure you also try out the mode where you are given a set 
number of moves to clear the screen by relying on combos... this mode is a real 
brain buster.<i> </i></b>Although this game has been re-released multiple times 
as Pokemon Puzzle League and Panel De Pon, I think the SNES Tetris Attack version is by far 
the best. Truly classic.<p>

How games should be converted into 3D.<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>Metroid Prime was another game that I had serious doubts about before I 
played it. When I learned that Nintendo had farmed development out to the then 
unknown Retro Studios and they were making Metroid into a first person shooter I 
was sure this great franchise was done for. Luckily, I was worried for nothing - 
Retro took the incredible gameplay of the Metroid franchise and made it even 
deeper and better by dropping it into a gorgeous 3D world. Metroid Prime 
single-handedly created the First Person Adventure genre, as it is far deeper 
than a typical FPS.
	
	<b>In fact, if all games were converted to 3D this well, I wouldn't rail 
against the slow demise of 2D games nearly as much as I do.<i> </i></b>With 
haunting environments, gorgeous music and sound effects, great puzzles, and a 
deep and involving plot, this game is a must play for anyone who considers 
themselves a game fan. <p>

Awesome<br></center>
        <p></p>

<p>I feel sorry for the kids today that have grown up on 3D games, because while there are some incredibly 
immersive gameplay experiences out there nowadays, this often comes at the price of dismissing 2D gaming, which is a big mistake. Actraiser was an incredible game that mixed side-scrolling action with a god sim type game where you built towns and took care of their 
inhabitants by protecting them from monsters and answering their prayers. The graphics were top notch even though Actraiser was a first generation SNES game, and the soundtrack by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro was one of the best to ever grace a game. Although a bit on the easy side, there are few better uses of a couple hours of your time than playing through Actraiser. I'll play this one until I die.</P>

        point and click adventures being pretty high on that list. Virtual 
        Stupidity is one of the best point and clicks I have ever played, and 
        unlike the horrible B&amp;B games on the consoles it 
        makes excellent use of the Beavis and Butthead license. This game is so 
        hilarious, I still remember and get a good laugh out of jokes in it even 
        though I haven't played it in a few years. Playing virtual stupidity is 
        literally like playing a Beavis and Butthead episode, complete with B&amp;B 
        ripping on videos. With deep puzzles, hilarious situations, fun 
        mini-games, and characters like Beavis and Butthead, you'd have to be a

        <p>Heroes of Might and Magic 2 is by far and away my favorite computer

        get old. It also has a beautiful symphonic and operatic music score and 
        great ambient noises in the background that really pull you into the 
        game. I love the colorful sprite based graphics in HOMAM 2 far more than 
        the bland washed out 3D characters in HOMAM 3 and 4, and prefer the 
        gameplay in part two compared to its successors as well. Even though 
        this game is now a good 10 years old, I'll never stop playing it. What a 
        great game. </p>

        of everything in my path. I can't think of&nbsp; more intense and mindlessly 
        fun first person shooters than Doom and Doom 2. I loved everything about 
        these games from the level design, to the gradually increasing strength 
        of the enemies, to the soundtrack, to the sweet, sweet sound of the 
        shotgun being cocked. At one time, Doom was the pinnacle of gaming, and 
        poor console owners were fed half-assed version after half-assed version 
        of it while PC gamers smugly played their perfect versions. The world 
        has changed a lot since then, but even now, I'll play classic Doom over

        the series justice I was in heaven. Indy, who is voiced by a remarkably 
        accurate voice actor controls like a dream. The fighting system is 
        excellent, with Indy throwing punches, using guns, broken items from the 
        environment, and of course his trademark bullwhip to put a hurtin' on 
        those damn Nazis. This game is everything Tomb Raider ever aspired to 
        be, only 100 times better, which comes as no surprise since Tomb Raider 
        has always been a big Indiana Jones rip-off anyway. With great gameplay, 
        one of the best characters of all time, and an awesome John Williams 
        soundtrack, how could this game go wrong? </p>

        <p>I played Pirates on Xbox, but it is pretty much the same on PC. You 
        begin the game as a lowly deck hand after your family is captured by an 
        evil pirate. After getting your own ship, you are free to do whatever 
        you want... pursue revenge, sack cities, attack ships heavy with gold 
        and wealth, declare your own personal war on another nationality, even 
        romance the beautiful daughters of city governors. It may seem basic at 
        first, but Pirates is one of those games that makes you keep saying 
        &quot;I'll just do one more thing&quot; until the next thing you know it's morning 
        and you haven't even been to bed yet. Few games have consumed me as 
        thoroughly as I was when I was playing Pirates, and for inspiring that 
        kind of obsession, Pirates definitely deserves a place on this list. </p>

        <p>100.  Unreal Tournament (LAN Play)&nbsp; (PC - GT Interactive - 2000)</p>

Killing Spree!!!<br></center>
        <i>
        <p></p>

        </i>
        <p>Unreal Tournament was an odd game... while it bored the heck out of 
        me in its single player mode, when my coworkers and I would get about 20 
        people playing it on the company LAN, I went berserk. Never before had I 
        experienced such a frenetic game... explosions echoed all around me 
        while the announcer would boom out things like &quot;Head Shot&quot; &quot;Rampage&quot; and 
        &quot;Killing Spree&quot;. The graphics were exceptionally well polished, and the 
        weapons were well thought out with great primary and secondary attacks. 
        With tons of options to tweak the gameplay and a fantastic capture the 
        flag mode, we played UT for months and 
        it never lost its thrill. Man I loved playing this game. </p>
        <p>-Fun Story: One day I was playing this on the LAN at my work while an 
        important client was visiting us. It was after hours, so I wasn't too 
        concerned about the client hearing us playing. I turned a corner in the 
        game and came face to face with another character so I blasted his ass 
        to smithereens. Then I found him a few minutes later and killed him 
        again. I began talking a ton of smack as I kept easily killing this guy, 
        never realizing that he was the client, who was a big game fan as well. 
        Luckily he took it well and I didn't endanger our contract with my big 
        mouth... I'm normally a calm guy, but Unreal Tournament seemed to bring 
        out an animal side of me when I played it. What fun! </p>

	    ##.  Starflight&nbsp; (Sega Genesis - Electronic Arts - 1991)<p>

A fantastically deep and wonderful game that only like 10 people ever played...<br></center>

        </i>

<p>When people talk about great games, there are always a few games that you can 
be pretty sure made the cut. However, if you are lucky you may learn about a 
hidden gem, a game that was great but for some reason was overlooked by gamers. 
Starflight for Sega Genesis is one of these overlooked treasures of gaming. In 
Starflight you start out as captain of a starship and need to outfit your 
vessel, train a crew, and explore the galaxy. There are over 900 planets in 
multiple solar systems and many alien races that range from friendly to 
downright aggressive. Starflight is completely open ended, so you are free to 
spend your time doing whatever you want. You can explore 
and mine planets, search for&nbsp; worlds suitable for human colonization,&nbsp; 
pursue diplomatic relations with other races, or attack other vessels and 
salvage their wreckage like a space pirate. During the course of play you will 
discover ancient artifacts and uncover a dark mystery that threatens all life in 
the universe. Games like Starflight are rare and precious, and I would recommend 
it to anyone. If ever a game deserved a modern sequel, Starflight is definitely 
it. What an awesome game.</P>

2 classic RPGs in one excellent remake: No official US release <br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Ok, here's the case for emulation... Dragon Warrior was a great 
        (although very basic) RPG on the original Nintendo. The series did ok 
        here in the states, but in Japan it enjoyed legendary popularity. It was 
        only natural then that the earlier versions of the series would be re-released on the Super Nintendo 
        with their graphics,&nbsp; sounds, and user interface upgraded. To sweeten 
        the deal, Enix even combined the first game with Dragon Quest (the name of the series 
        in Japan) II for the re-release. However, we never got a translated version of the game 
        here in the states because for some reason people here were not that 
        into RPGs in the early 90's. Luckily, thanks to hardcore fans, two 
        perfectly translated roms of this game were made, one with the original 
        Japanese names and one with the names that were used in the American 
        version of Dragon Warrior. While these games were fun on the NES, the 
        SNES version with its superior graphics and sounds is truly the way they were meant to be 
        played. If you are a fan of classic RPGs, give this game a try and enjoy 
        the origin of one of the best RPG series ever. Oh, and Enix, don't even 
        think of sweating me for emulating these... if you'd just release them 
        on the GBA I'd be the first in line to give you my money. (Hardheaded 
        jerks).</p>

I have a bad feeling about this...<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Here in Denver there used to be a sweet place called Celebrity 
        Sports Center that had bowling, A pool with 3 waterslides, and an 
        awesome multi-level arcade. Now, if you were to be looking for me in 
        that awesome arcade in my younger days, you wouldn't have to look much 
        further than the Star Wars Arcade machine. The vector graphics, while 
        simple, were very nice and did the ships and other objects in the game 
        justice, the control was perfect thanks to a cool flight yoke, the 
        gameplay was pretty varied for the time period, and the music and voice 
        samples from the movie really set the mood. You started out in space 
        destroying waves of TIE Fighters as Luke Skywalker in your X-Wing. After 
        wiping out the TIEs, you flew down to the nearby Death Star and 
        attempted to destroy it while dodging laser fire in the infamous 
        equatorial trench. If you destroyed the Death Star, you would fly back 
        into space to begin another, more difficult round with more aggressive 
        TIEs and even Lord Vader himself gunning for you. Even though it is over 
        20 years old now, this game is still a blast to play, which is a true 
        testament to its greatness. </p>

        <p>- Secret Tip: When you are in the Death Star trench, if you do not 
        fire any shots except the one into the thermal exhaust port to destroy 
        the Death Star you will get a 5000 point bonus for &quot;Using the Force&quot;. This 
        bonus even increases incrementally up to 100,000 points as you go to higher levels, if you can survive that 
        is. How cool is that???</p>

One of the finest Genesis games ever made<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;I'm not the biggest fan of the Beat-em-up genre that was popular in 
        the 90's as the games were all pretty derivative of each other. Imagine 
        my surprise then when I played Streets of Rage 2 at a friends house and 
        was blown away by how good it was. With huge stages, tons of different 
        types of enemies, excellent play control, memorable characters, fantastic 
        graphics, and one of the best soundtracks to ever grace the Genesis (by 
        the incredible Yuzo Koshiro) how could you go wrong? This is the game to 
        pull out when you are making your case for how great the Genesis was... 
        truly a masterpiece of game development and one of the best games in its 
        genre ever created.</p>

Pilotwings instructors have no patience for amateurs like you...<br><p>

I bought Pilotwings one day when I was a teenager with the meager earnings from 
my job. Looking back, I'm sure there were games with flashier cover art or 
cooler sounding concepts, yet for some reason I picked this game. That alone 
proves to me that I must have been the smartest damn teenager in the world. See, 
for a game that was released with little hype and had very sedate advertising, 
Pilotwings turned out to be one of the best games on the Super Nintendo. In 
Pilotwings you got to fly all manner of machines from biplanes to hang gliders, 
parachutes to rocket packs. there were numerous objectives to fulfill and quirky 
flight instructors to annoy or astound. Pilotwings also made excellent use of 
the Mode 7 scaling and rotation effects on the SNES. This game is still fun to 
play to this very day, and I personally think the original is far better than 
the N64 sequel that came out years later. Highly recommended!</center>

Too cool for words...<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;I managed a one person game store for years, and in that time had a 
        lot of parents wanting to know what games were good for kids. Many of 
        these parents would ignore my advice and instead pick some random Lego game, even though they were 
        usually crap. Knowing this track record of crappy games, I was wary when 
        I heard about the Lego Star Wars video game. Luckily, my worries were 
        for nothing. Lego Star Wars is a great game that covers all 3 of the 
        prequel movies. There are tons of characters to unlock and things to do 
        in this game and there is also a fantastic drop in/drop out anytime 2 
        player feature. Lego Star Wars was a bit easy, but it is so charming 
        that this is easily forgivable. I found it to be the perfect game to 
        play with my daughter, and would highly recommend it to anyone with kids 
        or who is just a Star Wars geek like me. My only complaint is that in 
        their rush to release Lego Star Wars near the theatrical release of Episode III 
        to capitalize on the inevitable marketing blitz that would follow, Traveler's Tales did not wait 
        for the Episode III soundtrack to be finalized so all of the Episode III levels have 
        music from other Star Wars movies in them. Not an issue for the typical 
        person I'm sure, but hell for geeks like me. Even so this is such a 
        great game, I can forgive them and that's saying a lot coming from a 
        Star Wars geek like me.</p>

Believe the hype... Snatcher rules.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Snatcher is one of those games that every publication and person who 
        has played it seems to rave on and on about. If you've never played 
        Snatcher, you may wonder if it is really <i>that </i>good... Well I'm 
        here to tell you it's probably better than what you've been told. Hideo 
        Kojima is at his finest in Snatcher, weaving a tale of betrayal and 
        intrigue unlike anything that had been released up to this point. 
        Borrowing heavily from Blade Runner, this cyberpunk thriller told the 
        convoluted story of Gillian Seed, a JUNKER who was out to discover the 
        origins of the mysterious Snatchers. These evil robots killed their prey 
        and then assumed their appearance, so you never know who is a person you 
        can trust 
        and who is really a Snatcher waiting to attack you without warning. This is a game worth buying a Sega CD and 
        the Justifier gun peripheral just to play. I just can't recommend 
        Snatcher highly enough. Snatcher is definitely a must play for anyone who considers 
        themselves a gamer. </p>

Mess with Ryo's father? That's your last mistake sucker....<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Shenmue was one of the most expensive games ever created in terms of 
        its production budget, and was an ambitious project to say the least. Yu 
        Suzuki was determined to create a game that mirrored reality down to the 
        smallest detail, and he crafted an epic plot that was originally to span 
        fifteen chapters. While it seems that Sega has abandoned the idea of 
        releasing all fifteen of these chapters, they did give us Shenmue. This 
        was truly one of the finest games on the Dreamcast. Every character in 
        the game was unique - no cheesy palate swaps or repeated voices here. 
        The smallest details were included, including an option to play the game 
        using the real weather conditions in 1986 Japan. As a big fan of this 
        game, I'll be the first to admit that Shenmue is not for everyone - 
        Those who don't have the patience to actually wait for busses in game or 
        get a job in game to earn money or deal with any of the numerous other 
        tiny details in Shenmue need not apply. Nevertheless, if you 
        don't mind a game that plays like real life (with all the highs and lows 
        that entails), Shenmue is the game for you. </p>

Don't let the cute characters fool you, this is a solid and tough shooter. <br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;This quirky little game starred an adorable Japanese girl who threw 
        cards at her foes and a cute little raccoon who threw leaves and could 
        deflect shots with his tail. Sounds too cute and silly to be any fun, 
        right? Well you'd be surprised at how well executed this game actually 
        was. This is a solid shooter with tons of enemies, good power-ups, screen 
        clearing bombs, the ability to deflect shots, and even the ability to 
        use your teammate as a weapon, sending them careening around the screen 
        laying waste to your enemies (in the excellent 2 player mode). With a very Japanese feel and a great 
        soundtrack, Pocky and Rocky was a real gem on the Super Nintendo and is 
        well worth playing even today.</p>

One of the crown jewels of gaming. Play it now.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Honestly I didn't care much for the first Metroid. This is largely 
        because the first Metroid game I ever played was the phenomenal Super 
        Metroid on the Super Nintendo, and after playing Super Metroid, it was 
        impossible for me to go back and appreciate the original. See, Super 
        Metroid is everything the original was multiplied by a factor of 100. This game was honestly one of the best 
        games of the 16 bit era, and is still one of the best games ever made. 
        With a huge area to explore, spectacular power-ups, great enemy variety, 
        tons of secrets, stellar graphics, and an incredible soundtrack, Super Metroid got everything right. If you haven't played this game, you are 
        out of your mind. Super Metroid is the definition of a true classic 
        game.

Possibly the most original game I have ever played. Awesome.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Katamari Damacy is such an odd game that it is impossible to 
        classify by any current gaming definition. You play as a tiny prince 
        who's father, the King of all Cosmos destroyed all of the stars in the 
        sky in a drunken fit. Now your irresponsible and just plain bizarre 
        father has tasked you with rebuilding the cosmos. How? By going down to 
        Earth and rolling up everything you encounter into your Katamari, a 
        sticky ball that absorbs everything it touches that is smaller than it. 
        The gameplay mechanics are very similar to rolling around a snowball and 
        making it bigger and bigger. With awesome Japanese music, incredibly 
        bizarre interludes, and simple yet addictive gameplay, Katamari Damacy 
        is one of the most unique games to ever come along. 
        Namco deserves a lot of credit for taking a chance and releasing this 
        game in the States, and I'm glad its done so well here. Hopefully this 
        will encourage other companies to release something besides endless 
        sequels and cookie cutter games. Katamari Damacy is a must play... it 
        will roll you up into its life - you'll roll up to be a single star in the sky. </p>

X-men - Check, Action RPG - Check, Totally Awesome - Check!<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;X-men Legends is a game that I think was specifically created for 
        me. With 15 different X-men, each with their own unique strengths and 
        weaknesses, tons of items to collect, a great RPG plot, and 4 player drop 
        in/drop out gameplay, X-men Legends had it all. For the uninitiated, I'd 
        compare this game to Gauntlet with the X-men and more RPG elements like 
        stat building and defensive items. I love this game! The only thing I'd 
        change would be to add a &quot;New Game +&quot; option like Chrono Trigger had so I 
        could play the game again with my fully powered up mutants from the 
        outset and really lay waste to my enemies. Even without this option 
        though, X-men Legends is by far and away the best X-men game ever, and 
        one of the best action RPGs I have played as well. A combination like 
        that will always have a place on this list in my book. </p>

4 player arcade madness! Cowabunga!<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were HUGE in the late 80's and early 
        90's... so huge it is hard to explain how popular they were to people 
        who did not experience the fad in its heyday. Like most popular 
        franchises, someone got the idea to branch off and create a TMNT video 
        game. Luckily for us, Konami was on the ball and instead of releasing 
        some crappy game that relied on name recognition more than gameplay 
        they released this gem of a game. Four players could play TMNT 
        simulatneously at their local arcade, guiding the Turtles through 
        colorful stages toward their inevitable confrontation with Krang and 
        Shredder. The graphics were gorgeous, playing TMNT was like playing 
        through an episode of the cartoon. All of the sound effects and voices 
        were perfect as well and the music was spectacular and is memorable to 
        this day. I loved playing as Donatello, and spent countless quarters on 
        this awesome game at Celebrity Sports Center, home of Denver's best 
        arcade at the time. I swear by all that is holy that someday I will own 
        a 4 player TMNT cabinet! </p>

A Sci-Fi Masterpiece.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;Star Control II is a phenomonal game that puts you in the middle of 
        one of the best science fiction stories I have ever experienced. You 
        were born and raised on a colony that had lost contact with Earth and 
        had no means of getting back home. After discovering an ancient 
        automated factory that was created to build starships, the colonists 
        expend all of their resources to create one massive ship. You are the 
        captain of this advanced vessel, and upon returning to Earth you 
        discover that it has become a slave world of the creul Ur-Quan 
        Heirarchy. These vicious creatures feel that it is their destiny to 
        either enslave or exterminate all other life in the universe. During the 
        course of your journey for humanity's freedom you will encounter many 
        different alien races, each with their own cultures and distinct 
        personalities. You'll explore the universe and uncover incredible plot 
        twists and turns as you move toward humanity's salvation or destruction. 
        Amazingly, this game was made almost entirely by only 2 incredibly 
        talented people. Many people and publications have praised this game as 
        one of the best of all time and they are right. A must play.</p>

The most charming RPG I've ever played.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;When I first played this game on Xbox, I loved it immediately. I've 
        always been a huge Indy fan, so when this game came out and finally did 
        the series justice I was in heaven. Indy, who is voiced by a remarkably 
        accurate voice actor controls like a dream. The fighting system is 
        excellent, with Indy throwing punches, using guns, broken items from the 
        environment, and of course his trademark bullwhip to put a hurtin' on 
        those damn Nazis. This game is everything Tomb Raider ever aspired to 
        be, only 100 times better, which comes as no surprise since Tomb Raider 
        has always been a big Indiana Jones rip-off anyway. With great gameplay, 
        one of the best characters of all time, and an awesome John Williams 
        soundtrack, how could this game go wrong? </p>

Squaresoft's finest hour.<br></center>
        <p>&nbsp;When I first played this game on Xbox, I loved it immediately. I've 
        always been a huge Indy fan, so when this game came out and finally did 
        the series justice I was in heaven. Indy, who is voiced by a remarkably 
        accurate voice actor controls like a dream. The fighting system is 
        excellent, with Indy throwing punches, using guns, broken items from the 
        environment, and of course his trademark bullwhip to put a hurtin' on 
        those damn Nazis. This game is everything Tomb Raider ever aspired to 
        be, only 100 times better, which comes as no surprise since Tomb Raider 
        has always been a big Indiana Jones rip-off anyway. With great gameplay, 
        one of the best characters of all time, and an awesome John Williams 
        soundtrack, how could this game go wrong?<i>

        excellent, with Indy throwing punches, using guns, broken items from the 
        environment, and of course his trademark bullwhip to put a hurtin' on 
        those damn Nazis. This game is everything Tomb Raider ever aspired to 
        be, only 100 times better, which comes as no surprise since Tomb Raider 
        has always been a big Indiana Jones rip-off anyway. With great gameplay, 
        one of the best characters of all time, and an awesome John Williams 
        soundtrack, how could this game go wrong? </p>

        be, only 100 times better, which comes as no surprise since Tomb Raider 
        has always been a big Indiana Jones rip-off anyway. With great gameplay, 
        one of the best characters of all time, and an awesome John Williams 
        soundtrack, how could this game go wrong? </p>
